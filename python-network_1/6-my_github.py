'''Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials (username and password)
 and uses the GitHub API to display your id

You must use Basic Authentication with a personal access token as password to
 access to your information (only read:user permission is needed)
The first argument will be your username
The second argument will be your password (in your case, a personal access token as password)
You must use the package requests and sys
You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)'''
